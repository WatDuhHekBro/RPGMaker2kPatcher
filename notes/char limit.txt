*Note* This was taken from 2k3, but should still be relevant.

Text is displayed in a fixed width font, allowing for up to 38 characters to be shown per line if a face graphic is displayed, and 50 characters without a face graphic. Up to four lines of text can be displayed at once.

Note that extra characters will still take up the text parser and won't let you click through the message until you that is finished.

Implementation: Start at the maximum position (50 or 38), then go backwards until you find a space (or punctuation). Then break the string at that point.
